A couple of typos I noticed: 

On Page 38 there's a Hasecke with a lower case "h" on the first line
Page 3, type on the second line of the first paragraph--"adn"
Page 3, typo on the first line of the third paragraph--"teh"
Page 6 May needs a cap at the end of the first line
Page 17 "Rhonald" should be "Ronald"
Page 17 Name under picture should be Brian Russell
Page 23 "his baptism" should be "her baptism
Page 41 the second Hasecke needs a capital "H"

No need to use every picture...I just wanted to give you some flexibility
Feel free to change captions for consistency
This is fabulous!! Thanks so much for doing it!
